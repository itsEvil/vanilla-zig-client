# Zig Vanilla 7.0 Realm Client 

### Imported from https://github.com/Slendergo/zig-client

This project is a modern and efficient Private Server Client built using Zig, a robust, optimal, and clear programming language. It is designed specifically to interface with the provided server source, tracking the latest master builds of Zig.

This client is designed to work on Windows, Unix flavours & MacOS. A multi-build script does not currently exist, and `zig build` will only build for your current platform at this time.

This Project is still in active development and may see major changes, both as it changes & Zig changes.
